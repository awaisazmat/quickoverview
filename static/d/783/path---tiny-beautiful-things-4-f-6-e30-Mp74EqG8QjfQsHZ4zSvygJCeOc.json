Someone who isn’t embarrassed by our emotions, or her own, who recognizes that life is short and that all we have to offer, in the end, is love.</p>\n<p>When I was done writing it, I understood that things happened just as they were meant to. That I couldn’t have written my book before I did. I simply wasn’t capable of doing so, either as a writer or a person. To get to the point I had to get to to write my first book, I had to do everything I did in my twenties. I had to write a lot of sentences that never turned into anything and stories that never miraculously formed a novel. I had to read voraciously and compose exhaustive entries in my journals. I had to waste time and grieve my mother and come to terms with my childhood and have stupid and sweet and scandalous sexual relationships and grow up. In short, I had to gain the self-knowledge that Flannery O’Connor mentions in that quote I wrote on my chalkboard.</p>\n<p>It was only then, when I humbly surrendered, that I was able to do the work I needed to do.</p>\n<p>I hope you’ll think hard about that, honey bun. If you had a two-sided chalkboard in your living room I’d write humility on one side and surrender on the other for you.</p>\n<p>You loathe yourself, sthe and yet you’re consumed by the grandiose ideas you have about your own importance. You’re up too high and down too low. Neither is the place where we get any work done.</p>\n<p>We get the work done on the ground level. And the kindest thing I can do for you is to tell you to get your ass on the floor.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to get a job that makes others feel comfortable about what they perceive as your success. You don’t have to explain what you plan to do with your life. You don’t have to justify your education by demonstrating its financial rewards. You don’t have to maintain an impeccable credit score. Anyone who expects you to do any of those things has no sense of history or economics or science or the arts.</p>\n<p>When you set new boundaries there is often strife and sorrow, but your life will be changed for the better.</p>\n<p>We are all savages inside. We all want to be the chosen, the beloved, the esteemed. There isn’t a person reading this who hasn’t at one point or another had that why not me? voice pop into the interior mix when something good has happened to someone else.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the greatest truth isn’t in the confession, but rather in the lesson learned.</p>\n<p>You go on by doing the best you can. You go on by being generous. You go on by being true. You go on by offering comfort to others who can’t go on. You go on by allowing the unbearable days to pass and allowing the pleasure in other days. You go on by finding a channel for your love and another for your rage.</p>\n<p>The kindest and most meaningful thing anyone ever says to me is: Your mother would be proud of you. Finding a way in my grief to become the woman who my mother raised me to be is the most important way I have honored my mother. It has been the greatest salve to my sorrow.</p>\n<p>Everything about that boy pacing the hallway tells me a story I need to know: that we do not have the right to feel helpless, Helpless Mom. That we must help ourselves. That after destiny has delivered what it delivers, we are responsible for our lives.</p>\n<p>understand that what you resolve will need to be resolved again. And again. You will come to know things that can only be known with the wisdom of age and the grace of years. Most of those things will have to do with forgiveness.</p>\n<p>You will regret the small thing you didn’t say for the rest of your life.</p>\n<p>Say thank you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tiny Beautiful Things - Cheryl Strayed","date":"January 12, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Tiny-Beautiful-Things/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/models/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Models - Mark Manson"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-five-love-languages/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The 5 Love Languages"}}}}
